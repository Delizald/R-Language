#Normal populations
sample(1:10,100,replace=TRUE) #number 1 to 10 x 100 times


#Mean
#*Numbers sampled will be relatively close to the mean
#*There is an equal chance of a number being above the mean as there is of it being below the mean

#Standard Deviation
#*Tells you how spread out you can epect your sample to be
#*If the population has a large standard deviation, essentially you 
#will be selecting numbers over a wider range.
